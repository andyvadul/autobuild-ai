## Course Overview

### Mission Statement

Enable business professionals to build THEIR OWN production-ready applications without writing code. You bring a real problem to solve. We give you the methodology, templates, and guidance to build it — module by module — until you deploy it live in the capstone.

### What Makes This Different

| Aspect | Autobuild.ai | Typical AI/Coding Courses |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **What You Build** | YOUR app (your idea, your problem) | Follow-along tutorial app |
| **Your Role** | Think about business, fill in templates | Learn to code |
| **AI's Role** | Writes ALL the code | Assists your coding |
| **You Touch Code?** | Never | Yes, constantly |
| **Output** | YOUR app, deployed and live | Portfolio exercise you'll never use |
| **Capstone** | Deploy what you've been building | Build something new at the end |

### The Reference Example: Task Tracker

Throughout the course, we use a **Task Tracker** as a reference example. You can:
- Look at its spec to understand how to write yours
- Compare your app's progress to it
- Use it as a fallback if you get stuck

But **you're not building the task tracker** — you're building YOUR app.

### Module 7: Capstone — Deploy YOUR App
**Duration:** 4-6 hours | **Self-directed**

This isn't a new project — it's the **completion** of what you've been building.

#### What You Do

1. **Final Polish** — Review YOUR app against your original spec
2. **Deploy** — Push YOUR app to production (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
3. **Present** — Record a 2-3 minute walkthrough
4. **Share** — Post to the community showcase

#### What You Deliver

- [ ] YOUR completed spec template
- [ ] YOUR working app (deployed and accessible via URL)
- [ ] Brief video walkthrough (2-3 min) of YOUR app
- [ ] Cost estimate (what will it cost to run YOUR app?)

#### What You DON'T Deliver

- ❌ Code explanations
- ❌ Technical architecture docs
- ❌ Test coverage reports

This is about **business outcomes**, not technical artifacts.

#### Success Criteria

Your app is successful if:
- It solves the problem you identified in Module 1
- It matches the spec you wrote in Module 2
- It's live and accessible to users
- You can explain what it does in business terms

---

## Spec Templates

The spec templates are the core deliverable of this course. They bridge business thinking and AI code generation.

### Template Hierarchy

| Template | Complexity | Best For |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **spec-template-simple.md** | Low | First-time builders, simple tools |
| **spec-template.md** | Medium | Most business applications |
| **spec-template-advanced.md** | High | Complex apps, integrations, multi-user |

### Template Structure

The main spec template includes these sections:

1. **App Overview** — What does it do, in one paragraph
2. **Users** — Who uses it, what roles exist
3. **Features** — What can users do (in business terms)
4. **Data** — What information gets stored
5. **Business Rules** — Logic, constraints, workflows
6. **Success Criteria** — How you know it's working
7. **Non-Goals** — What this app explicitly won't do

### Reference Example Specs

The course includes complete, working example specs you can reference:

- **Task Tracker** — Simple personal task management (primary reference)
- **Booking System** — Appointment scheduling with calendar
- **Client Portal** — Client-facing project/invoice viewer
- **Dashboard** — KPI tracking and visualization

Use these to understand the spec format, not as apps to build.

---

## Capstone: Deploy Your App

### App Ideas That Work Well

If you're not sure what to build, here are proven patterns:

#### Internal Tools
- Team task/project tracker
- Approval workflow system
- Inventory tracker

- Simple marketplace or directory
- Feedback/survey collector

#### Data/Reporting
- KPI dashboard
- Report generator
- Data entry forms
- Simple CRM

#### The Best Idea?
**Something YOU actually need.** If you'll use it, you'll finish it.

## Course Overview

### Mission Statement

Enable business professionals to turn ideas into production-ready applications without writing code. You focus on what matters — features, impact, and business value — while AI agents handle all the technical implementation. Using proven spec templates and automated build pipelines, go from business idea to deployed app.

### What Makes This Different

| Aspect | Autobuild.ai | Typical AI/Coding Courses |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Your Role** | Think about business, fill in templates | Learn to code |
| **AI's Role** | Writes ALL the code | Assists your coding |
| **You Touch Code?** | Never | Yes, constantly |
| **Output** | Production app, deployed | Portfolio exercise |
| **Time Investment** | Hours on specs, not syntax | Weeks learning languages |
| **Access** | Completely free, open source | $50-500+ |

## Spec Templates

The spec templates are the core deliverable of this course. They bridge business thinking and AI code generation.

### Template Hierarchy

| Template | Complexity | Best For |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **spec-template-simple.md** | Low | First-time builders, simple tools |
| **spec-template.md** | Medium | Most business applications |
| **spec-template-advanced.md** | High | Complex apps, integrations, multi-user |

### Template Structure

The main spec template includes these sections:

1. **App Overview** — What does it do, in one paragraph
2. **Users** — Who uses it, what roles exist
3. **Features** — What can users do (in business terms)
4. **Data** — What information gets stored
5. **Business Rules** — Logic, constraints, workflows
6. **Success Criteria** — How you know it's working
7. **Non-Goals** — What this app explicitly won't do

### Example Specs

The course includes complete, working example specs for:

- **Task Tracker** — Simple personal task management
- **Booking System** — Appointment scheduling with calendar
- **Client Portal** — Client-facing project/invoice viewer
- **Dashboard** — KPI tracking and visualization

---

## Capstone Projects

### Build One of These (or Your Own Idea)

#### 1. Client Portal
- Clients log in and see their projects/invoices
- You update status, they get notified
- Simple, professional, done

#### 2. Booking System
- Customers book appointments/services
- Calendar integration, reminders
- Payment optional

#### 3. Internal Dashboard
- Track KPIs, sales, inventory — whatever matters
- Pulls data from spreadsheets or forms
- Auto-updates, shareable

#### 4. Simple Marketplace
- List items/services for sale
- Buyers can browse and inquire
- Basic admin panel

#### 5. Your Own Idea
- Something for YOUR business or side project
- Must be a real problem you want solved
- Bonus: Actually launch it

### What You Deliver

- [ ] Completed spec template
- [ ] Working app (deployed and accessible)
- [ ] Brief video walkthrough (2-3 min)
- [ ] Cost estimate (what will it cost to run?)

### What You DON'T Deliver

- ❌ Code explanations
- ❌ Technical architecture docs
- ❌ Test coverage reports

This is about **business outcomes**, not technical artifacts.

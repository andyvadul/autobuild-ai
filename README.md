# Autobuild.ai

> **Your Spec, AI's Creation** — Build production-ready applications by writing specifications while AI handles all the code

---

## What is Autobuild.ai?

A free, open-source course that teaches business professionals to build real applications without writing code. You focus on **what** to build (features, business logic, user experience), while AI agents handle **how** to build it (code, databases, APIs, deployment).
